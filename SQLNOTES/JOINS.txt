JOINS :- IT IS THE PROCESS OF RETRIVING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TABLEs WHEN THOSE TABLES ARE IN RELATIONSHIP.

	SELECT TABLE1.COL1, TABLE1.COL2, ....., TABLE2.COL1, TABLE2.COL2,......
	FROM  TABLE1  <JOIN TYPE>  TABLE2   ON <JOIN CONDITION>;

JOIN CONDITION WILL BE SPECIFIED USING COMMON COLUMN OF THE JOINING TABLES. 
			TABLE1.COMMON_COL = TABLE2.COMMON_COL

JOIN TYPE:-  TEHRE ARE DIFFERENT TYPE OF JOINS
Inner Join
Outer Join
	Left Outer Join
	Right Outer Join
Self Join
Cross Join

INNER JOIN :-  IT RETRIVES  DATA FROM JOINING TABLES WHEN IT IS HAVING MATCHING VALUES/ROWS IN COMMON COLUMN.

SELECT EMP.ENAME, EMP.JOB, EMP.SAL, EMP.DEPTNO, DEPT.DNAME, DEPT.LOCATION
FROM EMP INNER JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;

USING TABLE ALIAS

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E  INNER JOIN DEPT AS D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;

DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WORKING RESEARCH DEPT

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E  INNER JOIN DEPT AS D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO WHERE D.DNAME='RESEARCH';

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E  INNER JOIN DEPT AS D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO 
WHERE E.DEPTNO =  (SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME ='RESEARCH');


OUTER JOIN  :-  IT WILL DISPLAY MATCHING AND NON - MATCHING ROWS FROM JOINING TABLES.

LEFT OUTER :-  IT WILL COMPARE VALUES FROM LEFT SIDE TABLE TO RIGHT SIDE TABLE OF JOIN PROCESS

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPT AS D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;

RIGHT OUTER :-  IT WILL COMPARE VALUES FROM RIGHT SIDE TABLE TO LEFT SIDE TABLE OF JOIN PROCESS

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, D.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E RIGHT OUTER JOIN DEPT AS D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;

SELF JOIN :-  
THIS TYPE OF JOIN IMPLEMENTED ON SINGLE TABLE WHEN THAT TABLE HAVING COL REFERENCEING.
HERE SINGLE TABLE SHOULD ASSUME THAT TWO TABLES WITH ALIAS NAME AND JOIN TYPE IS(INNER/OUTER)

SELECT M.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE, E.ENAME AS MANAGER FROM EMP AS M INNER JOIN EMP AS E
ON E.EMPNO = M.MGR;

SELECT M.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE, E.ENAME AS MANAGER FROM EMP AS M LEFT OUTER JOIN EMP AS E
ON E.EMPNO = M.MGR;

CROSS JOIN :-  IT IS USED TO RETRIVE DATA FROM TABLES WITHOUT JOIN CONDITION. 

SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, D.LOCATION  
FROM EMP AS E CROSS JOIN DEPT AS D;
