What is a Java?
It is a pure object oriented programming language to develop different applications. 

Java has got 3 part

J2SE - java 2 standard edition (core java)
	Programming Fundamentals
J2EE - java 2 enterprize edition (adv. java)	
	Application Development will be done here(web application, desktop application)
J2ME - java 2 Micro Edition
	this kind of programming used for developing micro applications.
		Mobile Apps, Bio-Metric Apps
-----------------------------------
to work with java, we need to download and install jdk 8.0 version atleast. 
to code the programs, we have download eclipse software.
	"JDK 8.0"
	"Eclipse"

Java is a platform independent programming language. So that java lang and it's related applications will run on any operating system. 

JVM :-  It is an execution engine for java program. it will take care of how java program will  be executed. 
Basically Jvm having different operating system envionments. 

JRE :-  it will provide enviorment for java application for an execution, providing library and other need tools. 
jre managed by jvm. 
-----------------------------------
Structure of Java:- 
-----------------------------------

importing packages

class <classname>
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		body of the program
	}
	..........................
}

1. packages are the library files of java. 
	A package consist  collection of classes and interfaces. 
	A class consist collection of methods(predefined functions).
	
	import packagename;
ex:-	import java.util.*;  // * represent all the classes. 
	import  java.util.Scanner; // scanner is a class.
	java.io, java.sql, ......

2.  Every program starts with a class and identified with classname. 
3.  program execution will be starts from main() method.
4.  main() method will not return any value, so that it is preceded with "void".
5.  static methods will be executed without an object. 
6.  public specifies  that the methods will be executed inside and outside of the class. 
--------------------------------------------
Output Statement :- 

System.out.println()  :-  this statement will print msgs or variable values on moniter line by line. 
System.out.print()  :-  this statement will print msgs or variable values on moniter side by side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data types :- 

there are two types of data types in java. 

1  Value Type		:-
	this type of data types allow to store values directly in  a variables. 
	all primitive types are value type. 
	keywords :-   byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean, .....

	Integer Types :-  byte, short, int, long
	Decimal Types :-  float, double
	Character  :-  char
	Boolean Type(true/false) :-  boolean
 
2. Reference Type 	:-
	this type of data types allo to store values in the form of object.
	all user defined data types are reference type.
	keywords :-  enum, class

What is a variable? 
	It is a named memory location to store values temp. 
	
	<data type>  <variablename>[= <value>];

	int x = 100;
	float y = 12.45;
	char  z = 'A';
----------------------------------------
Operators :- these are symbols which has specific action b/w operands. 

Arithematic Operators :-  +, -, *, /(div), % (remainder)
Relational :-   >, <, >=, <=, != (not equals), == (equals)
Logical :-   && = AND,  || = OR, ! <=>   NOT 
Unary  :-  ++ increment by 1,  -- decrement by 1
Assignment :-  =  (to store value in a variable),  +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Conditional :-  ? :  (condition) ? <true> : <false>
Concatenation :-  +, is used to concatenate two strings or String with any other data type value. 
-------------------------------------------------------
Input to java program :- 

there is a class by name  "Scanner" is used to input program. 

Steps :- 

1. import java.util package
	import java.util.Scanner;
2. Create object for that class in main() method as follows
	Scanner  <objectname>  = new Scanner(System.in);
3. Use following methods to read values into variables
	int  = nextInt()
	float = nextFloat();
	double = nextDouble()
	long = nextLong()
	byte = nextByte()
	short = nextShort()
	Strings  = next(), nextLine()
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple If :-

if(condition)
{
	set of stmts
}
--------------------
if-else 

if(cond)
{
	set of stmts-1
}
else
{
	set of stmts-2
}
----------------
else if 

if(cond-1)
{
	set of stmts-1
}
else if(cond-2)
{
	set of stmts-2
}
